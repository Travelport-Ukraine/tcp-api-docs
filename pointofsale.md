# Point of Sale \(BSP zone\)

Airlines distribute their fares and inventory in a different way depending on the country of point-of-sale. Some carriers restrict specific fares only for sale on their domestic market, whereas others may offer different range of bookings classes depending on the origin where the agency is located.

Besides shopping results depend greatly on the number of carriers supporting ticketing in specific market \(BSP\). Basic shopping request without additional modifiers will return the lowest fare options on any ticketing \(validating\) carrier for the travel agency.

Prices can also differ between countries because of market conditions also because currecncy rate changes.  Airlines generally quote fares in the currency of the country in which travel agency is located, but sometimes fares are quoted in fully convertible currencies \(USD, EUR\).
