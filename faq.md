# Frequently asked questions

### 1. How long data is being kept in cache?

Cache data is stored for a year from a day it was received, though it could be updated by cheaper result \(in case of Historical cache\) or more fresh result \(in other cases\). Meanwhile, any result data set returned by our API will be accompanied by the _age of the data_. So you can see how long ago \(in milliseconds\) this data were processed on Travelport servers. Depending on your strategy and based on this figure your algorithm can decide if it can rely on this particular data set or it is outdated for your purposes.

### 2. Is cache data accuracy dependent on point of sale?

Cache data accuracy depends on data volume and Travelport market share for particular market.

### 3. When data in cache is being refreshed?

Cache data is being refreshed each time we receive search results from Travelport for particular point of sale and search query. In vast majority of cases it takes less then a second after shopping was done.

### 4. How many RPS eStreaming API could handle?

eStreaming API is based on fully scalable architecture which allows us to process virtually unlimited RPS count.

### 5. Is it possible to search eStreaming API cache by cabin class?

Because Business shopping is relatively rare, there is very low probability that it is is possible to build respective cache on it. Data will always be outdated because of low frequency of host requests. Besides, business travelers are usually very demanding clients, and that is why majority of agencies uses direct requests to GDS to get the most sharp results for them. Fortunately there is not so much such requests and it should not seriously harm look 2 book ratio.

### 6. How do requests for the same city pair, but in various point of sales?

If you need to search the same route in different point of sales would will need to make several requests to eSteaming API, and so they count as several requests. Depending on your programming strategy these requests could be sent simultaneously or consequently. eStreaming API support both approaches.

### 7. We have 150 000 requests per day. Which RPS capacity do we need?

Required RPS capacity is much dependent how your requests are distributed during the day. Basic math shows that 150000 requests / 86400 seconds = 1.73 RPS per day.

But you should consider that requests distribution is not flat during the day. If, for example, you have almost none requests during the night and doubled activity during the night, you should reserve an amount of capacity that will be enough to serve your peak periods. However short bursts of activity should be taken into account, and it's highly recommended to implement consequent retry API calls in case you receive API response message, that you are over your capacity.

For further information about capacity, please visit [Capacity Planning](/capacity-planning.md) page.

### 8. 1000 requests per day in a free tier is not enough for me. Can I ask you to give me more?

We do not have 2000 or 10000 or any other then 1000 requests limits in free tier. The lowest possible daily limit after 1000 is 1 RPS. It is actually 86400 requests per day \(1 RPS \* 60 sec \* 60 min \* 24h\). It will cost you a peanuts \($5 for a day\). If you need 1RPS or more just for a couple of days please contact our sales department for invoicing.

### 9. Which point of sales are available?

Currently we process all data that Travelport sends us from following markets "AE", "AF", "AL", "AS", "AT", "AZ", "BA", "BY", "CZ", "DE", "EE", "ES", "FI", "FR", "HK", "HU", "ID", "IE", "IT", "JP", "LT", "LV", "MD", "MK", "NL", "NZ", "PK", "PL", "PT", "RO", "RS", "SK", "SZ", "UA", "US", "ZA". Feel free to use any from this list in your requests.

### 10. I need an additional point of sale which is not in the list. What should I do?

We can process literally any number of point of sales that Travelport is ready to provide us with. However, our expanses are linearly dependent on the number of processed transactions. So there is no financial sense to process data from markets that doesnâ€™t have any clients yet. This is especially important for big markets. If you will express real interest to go for paid access will be more than happy to turn on any additional markets. Currently we can discuss an opportunity of implementation of additional point of sales with clients who are ready to buy reserved 3-10 RPS \(depending on the size of data generated by requested point of sale\)  capacity for 3 month minimum.

### 11. Data about some particular route isn't available in selected point of sale?

Please keep in mind, that some destinations are very unusual for some markets. For example PEK-LAX  is very-very rare request for Ukranian agencies. Meanwhile, IEV-HRK is very rare in Australia. So the probability that someone ever searched this destination \(especially for some particular days of flights\) is infinitely low. For the test purposes, please use destinations that could be theoretically popular in appropriate market. Remember that any data that we have it is a stat that someone searched before.

### 12. I've found a proposal that suits my customer's request. How can I book it?

The best way to do a booking is [Travelport Universal API](https://www.travelport.com/solutions/travelport-universal-API). The most sexy way of using uAPI is [uAPI-JSON](https://github.com/Travelport-Ukraine/uapi-json). It depend of your booking strategy. But the best practice is following:

Once you know Dates, Flight number, Fare, Airline etc, you can try to do a [direct booking](https://github.com/Travelport-Ukraine/uapi-json/blob/master/docs/Air.md#bookparams). If it is successful that's it. If seats is no longer available in this class, just send a [direct booking](https://github.com/Travelport-Ukraine/uapi-json/blob/master/docs/Air.md#bookparams) request without _fareBasisCode_ and _bookingClass_ parameters as a result booking will be done in the cheapest available class on the same flight. It is strongly recommended to notify your client about price change if it is occurred.

### 13. Can I see my confidential \(negotiated\) fares in search results?

Because of the obvious reasons Travelport doesn't share with us all confidential fares of all agencies from all over the World. However, we do consider an opportunity to build a private data partitions for some selected customers once this customer authorize us to process it's confidential fare. It will require separate processing and separate data storage and as a result it will cause additional expenses for us. Currently we can discuss an opportunity of implementation of Private Data Partition only with clients who reserved 20+ RPS capacity for 3 month minimum.
